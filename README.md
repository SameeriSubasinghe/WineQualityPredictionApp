# WineQualityPredictionApp

   Machine learning is a widely used technology that aids us in day-to-day activities.  It is highly used in fields such as business, medicine, and other science related fields. Using data mining and machine learning approaches, this project explores a real-world issue and proposes a solution. Consequently, the selected problem is associated with the quality of wine.
Wine is one of the most consumed beverages in the world. Therefore, quality of wine is highly important in order to attract customers and wine sellers and also in order to gain a good revenue, in the competitive market, quality of wine at an optimal level is vital. If the quality of wine drops, wine manufacturers have to spend a lot of money in order to implement from the beginning. 

 Random Forest, Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbour and Decision Tree were the four techniques we utilized to evaluate the classification model. This provides the manufacturer a better notion of how to fine-tune the wine quality by altering various development-process aspects.
In this project, we have preprocessed the data and built several models and compared each one of them and chosen the best model and came into a conclusion.
